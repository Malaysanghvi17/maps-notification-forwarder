An Android app to relay Google Maps navigation notifications to smartwatches and other wearables that don't receive them natively.


## The Problem

Many Smartwatches and fitness trackers, especially those not running Wear OS (such as Samsung Fit 3, etc.), have basic notification support. They can show you incoming calls and text messages, but they often fail to display complex or persistent notifications from third-party apps like Google Maps.

This means that while you're driving, cycling, or walking, you can't get those crucial turn-by-turn directions with a quick glance at your wrist. You're forced to look at your phone, which can be inconvenient.

## The Solution

This App solves the problem by acting as a middle-man. It runs a lightweight, reliable service on your phone that:

1.  **Listens** specifically for notifications generated by Google Maps during active navigation.
2.  **Extracts** the vital information: the direction (e.g., "Turn right on Main St") and the distance/time.
3.  **Creates** a brand new, clean, and simple notification containing this information.

Because this new notification is a standard Android notification, almost any smartwatch's companion app (like Samsung Galaxy Wearable, etc) can easily pick it up and push it to your wrist, just like a text message.

### Key Features

-   **Real-time Relaying**: Get navigation updates on your watch instantly.
-   **Broad Compatibility**: Works with any wearable that can receive standard app notifications.
-   **Efficient**: Uses a Foreground Service to run reliably in the background without draining your battery.
-   **Simple UI**: A single button to start and stop the monitoring service.
-   **Privacy-Focused**: The app only reads notifications from Google Maps and does not store or transmit any data.
-   **Free & Open Source**: No ads, no tracking.

## Setup for Developers (Building from Source)

If you want to modify the code or build the app yourself, follow these steps.

#### Prerequisites
-   Intellij IDEA IDE with gradle setup or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (latest stable version recommended).
-   An Android device or emulator running API 26 (Android 8.0) or higher.

#### Building
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    https://github.com/Malaysanghvi17/maps-notification-forwarder.git
    ```
2.  **Open in Android Studio:**
    -   Launch Android Studio.
    -   Select `File > Open` and navigate to the cloned project directory.
3.  **Sync Gradle:**
    -   Let Intellij Idea download all the necessary dependencies.
4.  **Build and Run:**
    -   Go to Build -> Build App Bundle(APKs).

### Technical Overview

-   **`NotificationListenerService`**: The core of the app. `MapsNotificationListener.kt` extends this service to gain access to the notification stream and filter for Google Maps updates.
-   **`Foreground Service`**: To ensure the `NotificationListenerService` is not killed by the Android system when the app is in the background, it promotes itself to a foreground service, displaying a persistent notification.
-   **`BroadcastReceiver`**: The service communicates with the `MainActivity` (the UI) by sending broadcasts. This allows the UI to display logs of the notifications being relayed.
